personal info:
UE4 c++ based project hack/fight prototype game.
This project is created with ue4 using my desktop pc and a laptop sometimes.

technical info:
Only the source, content/maps, and content/blueprints need to be tracked, everything else is a generic ue4 file.
This project may use market assets that will obviously not be uploaded here.
